# Nomad

## Description

The professional convention scene is very large and constantly growing - with 90 million participants and 284,000 conventions every year in the US alone.

The participants usually look for networking opportunities with other colleagues from their field of work.

The goal for the Nomad project is to assist those participants with finding the people they’re looking for - quickly and easily. It allows convention organizers to publish and manage conventions, and potential participants to search conventions (by name or location), register and build their network for the conventions.

Participants can then look at the list of other convention participants, message them, and even see their live location at the event (if enabled).
